            <li><strong>Main Actor :</strong> Hrithik Roshan, Tiger Shroff</li>
            <li><strong>Description :</strong> In New Delhi, Major Kabir Dhaliwal is assigned to assassinate an Iraqi
                terrorist named
                Farid
                Haqqani, but instead kills veteran RAW agent V. K. Naidu. Defence Minister Sherna Patel and Colonel
                Sunil
                Luthra assign Kabir's former student Captain Khalid Rahmani (Tiger Shroff) to eliminate him.

                In a flashback, Khalid Rahmani yearns to join Kabir's squad, but is initially rejected due to Khalid's
                father Major Abdul Rahmani betraying the army in a previous mission, leaving Kabir with two gunshot
                wounds
                and his partner dead. After being persuaded by Luthra, Kabir reluctantly agrees to let Khalid join his
                team.
                The squad consists of agents Saurabh, Prateek, Muthu and Aditi.

                The team goes on a successful mission in Tikrit, Iraq to kill Haqqani's associates and are able to
                arrest a
                terrorist named Basheer Hassib, causing their main target Rizwan Illyasi, a terrorist turned businessman
                to
                come out of hiding. Despite the mission's success, Kabir notices that Khalid missed many of his targets
                from
                his right side and lacks peripheral vision, leading to Kabir threatening Khalid for removal from his
                squad.
                Khalid reveals that as a result of his father's betrayal, his eyesight was partially damaged due to a
                bullying incident in his childhood. Seeing his love for his mother and country, Khalid is reinstated.
                The
                team captures Illyasi in a mission in Marrakesh, during which Illyasi informs Kabir that he planted a
                mole
                within the team. Saurabh reveals himself as the mole and kills Prateek and Muthu. A shootout ensues
                between
                Kabir and one of Illyasi's men. Kabir gets injured and wakes up in a hospital a few days later. There,
                he
                meets an injured Khalid who tells him that he killed Saurabh.

                In the present, Khalid is nearly taken off the mission until Lt. Col. Jimmy Shroff is brutally killed by
                Kabir, who organises a meeting with Khalid on a metro, revealing his next target is Dr. Uptal Biswas in
                Lisbon. Khalid fails to prevent Biswas from being killed by Kabir, leading to his suspension. Khalid
                tracks
                down Kabir through a previous mission, where he learns that six months ago, Kabir was on a covert
                operation
                to find a government hard drive with secret codes and was targeting Illyasi's known associates. Khalid
                also
                learns that Kabir faked a relationship with a dancer named Naina Sahni in Italy in order for her to spy
                on
                Firoze Contractor, one of Illyasi's associates. Naina was ultimately killed by Firoze, and Kabir deduces
                that Firoze was Illyasi, who became Firoze through plastic surgery. Kabir and Khalid agree to work with
                each
                other, but Kabir's hideout is attacked; and the duo flee to Kerala where they attend Aditi's wedding and
                recover a hard drive with the codes. Kabir hands the drive to Khalid for safekeeping.

                While celebrating the mission's success on a houseboat, Khalid poisons Kabir's drink with TTX,
                revealing, in
                a shocking twist, that he is in fact, Saurabh. In a flashback, upon learning Saurabh's true colors, a
                fight
                between Khalid and Saurabh ensued. In the midst, Illyasi shoots Khalid in the back multiple times before
                being stabbed by Saurabh, killing him. Saurabh informs Illyasi of his troubles regarding the plan and
                brings
                him to Dr. Mallika Singhal, a renowned plastic surgeon, to change his identity to Khalid so that Kabir
                does
                not know about his true identity. Mallika changes Saurabh's vocal cords and adjusts his face, making
                Saurabh's scars only visible to become Khalid. After Saurabh reveals his true identity to Kabir, he
                throws a
                weakened Kabir into the river. In the Arctic Circle, Saurabh returns to Illyasi who is located on an
                icebreaker ship. Kabir arrives in a parachute onto the ship, and kills Illyasi's men. Kabir confronts
                Saurabh for his betrayal and reveals to him that he knew his true identity all along, after having seen
                him
                shoot perfectly from his right side, which Khalid couldn't due to his eye defect, and drinking alcohol,
                something Khalid abstains from owing to his religious beliefs. Aditi had provided Kabir with an antidote
                for
                the poison and inserted a GPS tracker in the drive, when handing it over to Saurabh for safekeeping.

                Saurabh kills Illyasi and escapes to a derelict church, while being chased by Kabir. A fight occurs,
                ending
                with Saurabh being crushed by a falling church dome killing him as Kabir walks out.

                Khalid is posthumously honoured for his sacrifice, while his mother Nafeesa receives an award from the
                Prime
                Minister on his behalf. Kabir, who is still believed to be a traitor, takes care of Naina's daughter
                Roohi
                whom he has adopted. After speaking with Luthra, Kabir agrees to go on a covert mission to kill Haqqani.
                Later, Kabir and Roohi surf together at Bondi Beach in Sydney, fulfilling Naina's wish of surfing with
                her.</li>

            <li><strong>Main Actor :</strong> Tiger Shroff</li>
            <li><strong>Description :</strong> Raghav Shetty, a Kalaripayattu and a martial arts world champion and a
                dreaded
                gangster, abducts Siya Khurana from her film set in Hyderabad and takes her to Bangkok. Siya's
                father, P.P. Khurana, along with Dasanna, a film producer, seeks the government officers and cops
                for help, but no one is ready to assist them as Raghav is an influential person and there is no
                extradition treaty between India and Thailand. Khurana then suggests to Dasanna that Ranveer "Ronny"
                Pratap Singh, Siya's ex-boyfriend and a rebellious martial artist, can destroy Raghav and rescue
                Siya. Initially hesitant, Ronny agrees as he needs money to treat Subbu, a mute young boy who is
                being treated for his vocal cords.

                Past: Ronny meets Siya on a train and falls in love with Siya at first sight. He also sees that Siya
                also carries a rebellious personality. Raghav also sees Siya and is beset with her. At the behest of
                his late father, Colonel Samarjit Singh, Ronny unwillingly becomes a student in the Kalaripayattu
                Royal Academy of Martial Arts in Kerala, headed by Kailash Shetty a.k.a. Guruswamy, Samarjit's
                former army colleague and Raghav's father. In due course of time, Guruswamy disciplines Ronny into a
                rebel with a cause, thus making Ronny a rebellious martial artist and the master of the art of
                Kalaripayattu. As time goes on, Ronny and Siya fall in love with each other.

                A money-minded Khurana agrees to marry Siya off to Raghav, who lures him with bundles of money. On
                learning that Siya is in love with Ronny, Khurana rats Ronny out to Raghav, who swears to kill him.
                Guruswamy overhears the plan and objects to it strongly. Feeling humiliated and enraged, Raghav
                kills Guruswamy by poisoning him to death. Later, Raghav tells his henchmen to get Ronny in front of
                him. The henchmen tries to harm Ronnie and Subbu, but Ronny beats up Raghavâ€™s henchmen brutally.
                Following a confrontation with Raghav and later at Guruswamy's funeral, Khurana creates an
                atmosphere of misunderstanding in league with Raghav, causing Ronny and Siya to break up and part
                ways.

                Present: Ronny reaches Bangkok and visits Raghav's fight club, beating the most potent fighter to
                attract Raghav's attention. Raghav sends his henchmen to kill Ronnie, but Ronnie beats them up
                brutally. The next day, Ronny breaks into the house of Biju, Raghav's right-hand man, and holds
                Biju's wife at gunpoint, forcing him to reveal Siya's location. Learning that she is at the local
                hospital, Ronny saves Siya and escapes with her under both of them being disguised. Raghav manages
                to spot them, but couldn't do anything. The two stop at an island on their way back to India, where
                Siya discovers her father's deceit and the couple reunite. Raghav and his men suddenly attack the
                couple off-guard, where Biju shoots Ronny, who falls off a cliff.

                Raghav takes Siya back to his place, but Siya realizes that Ronny is alive, with Raghav being
                alerted to his invasive underbelly moments later. Realizing Biju's treachery, Raghav questions him
                and Biju affirms that he spared Ronny as he had spared his wife earlier. Raghav is unconvinced and
                finishes Biju. Ronny storms Raghav's building and single-handedly fights all the killers and
                swordsmen in Raghav's employ. Ronny reaches Raghav, who initially overpowers him. Raghav also
                reveals himself as the mastermind behind Guruswamy's death. Enraged, Ronny uses Guruswamy's
                signature moves and kills Raghav, thus avenging Guruswamy's death. Now happily together with Siya,
                Ronny becomes the new teacher in Guruswamy's school.</li>

            <li><strong>Year : 2016</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Main Actor : Salmaan Khan</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Description :</strong>Sultan Ali Khan, a middle-aged former wrestling champion, lives a lonely
                life in the town of Rewari, Haryana. Aakash Oberoi, the founder of Pro Takedown, a private mixed martial
                arts league, funded by Mr. Patel, is encouraged by his father to recruit Sultan to salvage its
                popularity. After travelling to Haryana, he offers to recruit Sultan, who bluntly refuses because of his
                retirement from wrestling. Aakash asks Sultan's close friend Govind, who narrates how Sultan's career
                begun.

                Sultan fell in love with Aarfa Hussain, a state-level wrestler and daughter of a local wrestling coach.
                She initially dislikes him, but later accepts him as a friend. When he confesses his love to her, she
                insults him, and tells him that she would only marry a well-trained wrestler. Determined to win her
                respect, Sultan dedicates himself to intense training and ultimately wins a state-level wrestling
                tournament, and Aarfa. They eventually get married and become famous wrestlers, representing India in
                various international games.

                When they are both selected to compete at the Olympics, Aarfa discovers that she's pregnant. She gives
                up her childhood dream of winning a gold medal for India, which Sultan fulfills. To her surprise,
                Sultan's fame causes him to be arrogant, and he slaps a reporter at an event. He also leaves Aarfa, who
                is nearing her due date, to win a gold medal in Turkey. Upon his return, he learns that his newborn son
                had died due to severe anemia. His son had a rare O-blood type, identical to Sultan's, depriving the
                child of a donor. Angered, Aarfa leaves Sultan to live with her father. Devastated, Sultan decides to
                raise funds to open a blood bank in his son's name.

                In the present, Aakash promises Sultan that the tournament's prize money will go towards fulfilling his
                dream of opening a blood bank. Sultan agrees to participate and travels to Delhi, where Aakash
                introduces him to coach Fateh Singh, who initially refuses to train him but agrees after seeing his
                determination. After 2 months of intense training, Sultan is able to regain his physique and learns
                freestyle wrestling. In his first fight, Sultan defeats the opponent using capoeira. He soon becomes a
                nationwide sensation after winning a series of matches and gains Aarfa's support in the process.

                In the semi-final round, Sultan wins the fight but is severely injured and is hospitalized. The doctor
                informs Aakash that if Sultan continues fighting, his injuries would become fatal. Aarfa arrives at the
                hospital and motivates him to continue fighting. In the final round, Sultan overcomes his pain to defeat
                his opponent and ultimately wins the tournament. Reunited with his wife, Sultan opens a blood bank using
                the prize money, and Aarfa resumes wrestling. A few years later, she gives birth to a baby girl, whom
                Sultan begins to train as a wrestler.</li>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Year : 2001</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Main Actor : Vin Diesel</strong> Salman Khan</li>
            <li><strong>Description :</strong>In 2000, actor Paul Walker had worked with director Rob Cohen on The
                Skulls. Cohen secured a deal with producer Neal H. Moritz for an untitled action film for Universal
                Pictures, and approached Walker and asked him to suggest his "dream" action film; Walker suggested a
                mash-up of the films Days of Thunder (1990) and Donnie Brasco (1997).[31] Soon thereafter, Cohen and
                Moritz brought him the Vibe magazine article "Racer X" by Ken Li, published in May 1998, which detailed
                underground street racing operating in New York City,[1] and suggested a story set to follow Walker as
                an undercover cop tasked with infiltrating the world of underground street racing in Los Angeles
                inspired by the article.[31] Upon hearing this, Walker signed on immediately; finding his co-star proved
                difficult. The studio warmed toward the idea of Timothy Olyphant in the role of Dominic Toretto, due to
                the success of the blockbuster Gone in 60 Seconds (2000), but he declined. Moritz persisted on Vin
                Diesel following his performance in Pitch Black (2000), with Diesel accepting after proposing several
                script changes. Moritz had difficulty choosing between the titles Racer X (after the article), Redline,
                Race Wars and Street Wars, but was ultimately inspired by a documentary on American International
                Pictures, which included the 1954 film The Fast and the Furious. Moritz was traded use of some stock
                footage to its director, Roger Corman, in exchange for a license to use the title.[32][33] Upon release
                in June 2001, the film shattered box office expectations and a sequel was green-lit.[31]

                Diesel declined to return for the sequel, saying that the screenplay was inferior to its predecessor.
                Cohen also declined the sequel, opting to develop the film XXX (2002), which starred Diesel in the lead
                role. To account for these changes, Universal commissioned the writers to create a standalone sequel
                with Walker in the lead and brought in John Singleton as the new director. Filming was delayed by a year
                and the production location shifted to Miami. Tyrese Gibson, who worked with Singleton on the film Baby
                Boy (2001), was hired as Walker's new co-star[31] for what was also the first entry in the series to
                feature long-running cast member Ludacris.

                Universal attempted to bring back Diesel for the third installment, but he again declined due to other
                projects and a dislike for the script.[34] After failing to secure the returns of Walker or any other
                member of the original cast, Universal ordered a stand-alone film of the franchise. Screenwriter Chris
                Morgan subsequently attempted to revive the series primarily for car enthusiasts, introducing new
                characters, focusing on a car-related subculture and moving the series to Tokyo; Japan contains one of
                the world's largest automotive industries. It is the first film in the series to start its tradition of
                filming in locations outside the United States.[35] Moritz returned and hired director Justin Lin,
                having been impressed with Lin's work for the film Better Luck Tomorrow (2002), which shared similar
                elements with Tokyo Drift. The third film marked the first appearance in the Fast & Furious franchise of
                Han Lue, portrayed by Sung Kang, a character who originated from Lin's Better Luck Tomorrow. Although
                the relation between Better Luck Tomorrow and Fast & Furious was originally left unaddressed, both Lin
                and Kang repeatedly confirmed during the following years that it was the same character, and that Better
                Luck Tomorrow doubled as Han's origin story, retroactively making the film part of the Fast & Furious
                continuity.[36][37] Moreover, with Tokyo Drift, the series was able to bring Diesel in for a cameo
                appearance, in exchange for letting the actor's production company acquire the rights to the Riddick
                character.[38][39] The third film was the least financially successful of the franchise, received
                lukewarm reception and left the future of the franchise in limbo.[40]

                Away from the franchise, Diesel made a string of box office or critical flops, including The Chronicles
                of Riddick (2004), The Pacifier (2005) and Find Me Guilty (2006), but his cameo in Tokyo Drift generated
                interest in reviving the series.[40] After signing Diesel and confirming the return of Lin, Universal
                worked to track the first film's original co-stars and re-signed Walker, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana
                Brewster in mid-2008.[40] Walker was initially reluctant to rejoin the franchise after six years, but
                Diesel assured him that film would be considered the first "true" sequel.[31] Morgan returned to write
                after the critical praise for the character Han Lue. Given the apparent death of the character in the
                third film, the timeline of the franchise was altered to account for his appearance.[34] With the
                emphasis on car culture toned down, the fourth film, Fast & Furious, was a commercial success. Although
                critical reception was mixed, it reinvigorated the franchise, as well as the star power of Diesel and
                Walker.

            <li><strong>Main Actor :</strong> Rock</li>
            <li><strong>Description :</strong>In 1996, Brantford, New Hampshire, teenager Alex Vreeke receives Jumanji,
                which was previously disposed of by Alan Parrish and Sarah Whittle in 1969[a], from his father, who
                found it on the coast. However, he sets it aside, being only interested in video games. Later that
                night, Alex finds it transformed into a video game cartridge. Opting to play, he is sucked inside the
                game, disappearing from the real world as time continues to pass.

                Twenty-one years later, four Brantford High School students â€“ awkward Spencer Gilpin, athletic Anthony
                "Fridge" Johnson, ditzy Bethany Walker, and cynical Martha Kaply â€“ are given detention. Fridge and
                Spencer were caught cheating, and Bethany and Martha disrespected their teachers. Upon finding Alexâ€™s
                discarded video game system and starting it up, the group is sucked into Jumanji, landing in a jungle as
                their chosen avatars â€“ Spencer as muscular archaeologist Dr. Xander "Smolder" Bravestone, Fridge as
                diminutive zoologist Franklin "Mouse" Finbar, Bethany as male, overweight cartographer and
                paleontologist Professor Sheldon "Shelly" Oberon, and Martha as sultry martial arts expert Ruby
                Roundhouse. Three marks on their arms denote their lives in the game, making them afraid that if they
                lose all three, they will actually die.

                The group's goal is to end a curse on Jumanji, brought about by corrupt archaeologist Professor Van
                Pelt[b] after he stole a magical jewel called the "Jaguar's Eye" and gained control of the jungle's
                animals. They must return the jewel to the shrine and call out "Jumanji" to lift the curse and leave the
                game.

                Coping with their avatars, their "weaknesses", Van Pelt's men, and their own group dynamics as they
                begin their journey, they encounter Alex playing the fifth avatar â€“ pilot Jefferson "Seaplane" McDonough
                â€“ who takes them to a treehouse that Alan built during his tenure in Jumanji. Alex thinks he has only
                been stuck in the game for a couple of months; everyone, including him, is shocked to realize he has
                been there for two decades. The group coordinate with each other's strengths and work together to
                overcome the game's obstacles. They manage to return the jewel to the statue, break the curse, and
                return to the real world.

                Back in the present, the group finds the Vreeke home restored and lively from its previous state after
                Alex's disappearance. They meet Alex, now an adult, who explains that he returned to 1996, allowing him
                to live his life. He remained in Brantford and now leads a married life; his daughter is named after
                Bethany to honor her after she had saved him by sacrificing one of her own lives in the game.

                The four students form an unlikely friendship after their experiences in the game, having bonded and
                become better people. Soon after, they destroy the game to prevent it from endangering anyone else.</li>
